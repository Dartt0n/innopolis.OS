=== EXPLANATIONS ===
When we run the code normally (without chroot) it will list the
content of the root directory of out actual filesystem. This 
includes basic directories and files like /bin, /home, /usr etc.
However, when we run the code using "chroot" utility, it
changes root directory to the ./lofsdisk and therefore a new
root directory for the code is ./lofsdisk. Thus, when the code
reads "/" directory, it actually read lofsdisk. And since we
have created files "file1" and "file2" in this category, they
are listed when we iterate over / directory.

So, the difference in output between the two cases is due to the
difference in what is treated  as the root directory (/): in the
first case, it's the actual root directory of your system, and
in the second case, it's the root directory of the chroot
environment.
