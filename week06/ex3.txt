The SJF algorithm for this particalur set of the tasks works faster, than FCFS.
However, if in the FCFS algorithm every task would be performed, SJF could ignore for a while
a long task while there a ton of smaller ones
(this is happening in this data set with process id 3, it's wait time is 21s)

If all the processes appear at the same time, they will be processed one by one.
This is the worst case for the SJF.
