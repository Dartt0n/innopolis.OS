First fit :   716.91 ms
Best  fit :  1981.86 ms
Worst fit :  1942.12 ms

From the results, it seems that the First Fit algorithm performed the best in terms of execution time,
followed by the Worst Fit algorithm, and then the Best Fit algorithm.
This indicates that the First Fit algorithm was able to find a suitable memory block
for the data more quickly compared to the other two algorithms.
However, it's important to note that the execution time of memory allocation
algorithms can vary depending on various factors, such as the size of the memory space, 
the number of available memory blocks, and the fragmentation level. 
Therefore, it's possible for the performance of these techniques 
to differ in different scenarios. It's also worth mentioning that the execution 
time alone may not be the only factor to consider when evaluating the performance 
of memory allocation techniques. Other factors such as memory utilization, fragmentation levels, 
and fairness in resource allocation should also be taken into account for a comprehensive analysis.
