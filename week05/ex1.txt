Publisher works like this: main process reads the stdin for messages, then send the data to the unnamed pipes.
Subprocesses read from unnamed pipe and write to the corresponding named pipe.
Each subscriber reads its named pipe and prints message to the stdout.
This way, message, typed in stdin for publisher, appears at the same time to all subscribers.
Moreover, all the subscribers receive the message.

   ,_ unnamed pipe -> process 0 -> named pipe /tmp/ex1/s1 -> subscriber 1
   |
   |- unnamed pipe -> process 1 -> named pipe /tmp/ex1/s2 -> subscriber 2
main
   |- unnamed pipe -> process 2 -> named pipe /tmp/ex1/s3 -> subscriber 3
   |
   `- unnamed pipe -> process 3 -> named pipe /tmp/ex1/s4 -> subscriber 4
