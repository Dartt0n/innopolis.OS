> Change the macro TRI_BASE to a small number like 100 and run the scheduler again. Compare your results before and after the change?

Nothing has changed, except the number of found triangular numbers. The order of processes is the same and all the metrics are the same.
Therefore scheduler process is independent of workers work.

> Change the arrival time of all processes to make all of them zero, then run the scheduler again. In which order will processes be executed?

The processes are runned in order they appear in the file.
